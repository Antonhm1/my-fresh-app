# Issue #1: Set up initial pages and navigation

**Link:** https://github.com/Antonhm1/minKirke-code/issues/1

## Problem Description
- Make a home page and four subpages
- Make a burger menu in the top right corner with navigation to the different pages

## Current State Analysis
- Basic React 19.1.1 + TypeScript + Vite project
- Only has a simple HomePage component
- No routing system (React Router not installed)
- No navigation menu
- Components organized in folders with index.ts exports

## Solution Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Routing Infrastructure
1. **Install React Router DOM** - Add routing capability to the app
2. **Configure App.tsx** - Set up BrowserRouter and Routes structure
3. **Update main.tsx** - Ensure proper router setup

### Phase 2: Create Page Components
4. **Update HomePage** - Make it more appropriate for church website
5. **Create About page** - Information about the congregation/church
6. **Create Services page** - Service times and events
7. **Create Contact page** - Contact information and location
8. **Create News page** - News and events

### Phase 3: Navigation System
9. **Create BurgerMenu component** - Hamburger menu in top right corner
10. **Create Navigation component** - Links to all pages
11. **Add responsive styling** - Mobile-first approach
12. **Integrate with App layout** - Position menu correctly

### Phase 4: Styling & Polish
13. **Style the pages** - Basic layout and church-appropriate styling
14. **Add page transitions** - Smooth navigation experience
15. **Test responsive design** - Ensure works on mobile and desktop

## Technical Implementation Details

### Pages Structure:
```
src/
  components/
    HomePage/
    AboutPage/
    ServicesPage/
    ContactPage/
    NewsPage/
    Navigation/
      BurgerMenu.tsx
      NavigationMenu.tsx
```

### Routing Structure:
- `/` - Home
- `/about` - About
- `/services` - Services
- `/contact` - Contact
- `/news` - News

### Navigation Requirements:
- Burger menu icon in top right corner
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Smooth open/close animations
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

## Testing Plan
- Test all routes work correctly
- Test burger menu functionality
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Run existing test suite to ensure no regressions

## Deployment Considerations
- Ensure React Router works with Vite build
- Test navigation works in production build
- Verify all pages are accessible via direct URLs
